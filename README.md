# WiMP - Weekly Mileage Planner powered by Strava
The gist of it: A weekly mileage planner powered by Strava

## Why this app?
Strava has goals for weekly mileage on their app for premium subscribers (Summit), but they do not have a weekly planner/daily goal area. This might seem like an overkill feature, BUT hear me out. If you are running more than say 40 miles a week and you want to stick to a strict schedule so you hit your goal. You don't want to get to the weekend and realize you are short or way over. My solution to this is a whiteboard in my bedroom that has the days of the week. At the end/beginning of one week I plan everyday out. My workouts, recovery runs, group runs, long runs, and so on. That works, but when I'm not at home and I'm trying to plan a run with someone then that information is no longer in front of me. Now you could say I could just add my runs to my calendar or I could create a note/to-do list, but then I would have to come up with another app idea to get practice in. So shoo shoo with the negativity. This works for me.

## What is in this repo?
This repo has two apps in it, because I don't want to make a second repo.

The first app is written in Kotlin and is the main app. This is the one that'll actually be maintained and released to the play store if I get around to it. 

The second app is written in Java because I have some interviews coming up for Android positions and I need to practice both. I especially need to practice Java for the interviews as these are what most interviews are in. This will not be maintained or released. It will most likely only make it to the MVP stage.

## Stages of development
### MVP (In Progress)
- Set a goal for each day of the week
- Set a goal for the entire of week
- Pull in data from Strava API
    - Compare what you actually did vs goal

### V1.0 (Not Started)
- Push Notification Reminders

### V2.0 (Not Started)
- Keep stats on goal completion rate
- History of previous weeks

### V3.0 (Not Started)
- Daily mileage suggestion based off weekly goal
    - Button gives suggestion for empty days
- Rest day settings
- Long run day settings

### V4.0 (Not Started)
- All things social
- See how you stack up to your Strava friends

## Tech Stack
This section will change over time but currently this is what we are looking like:
- Kotlin (Main App)
- Java (Secondary App)
- Volley
- Glide
- Firebase

## The name
I don't have a good name for this app sooooo let's see what we can come up with. Can't be anything with the word Strava due to the brand guidelines. It doesn't deserve a creative made up word because let's be honest, it's a glorified to-do list. So how about we just take the first letter from some of the words that describe this and maybe we'll get something good. Like WiMP (Weekly Mileage Planner). Haha I got nothing so that's gonna have to do because it's better than SWaP (Strava Weekly Planner). Whatever. On to the logistics of this repo.

## Outro

That's all folks. No end credit scenes to be found here. Check back later for some screenshots/pretty graphics. Hit the star if you like it or open an issue if you hate it.

Sincerely Your Neighborhood Developer,
